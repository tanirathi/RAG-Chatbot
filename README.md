""" Basic Explanation of the RAG Model in This Implementation
This Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model is designed to process dialysis patient data from a CSV file and allow users to query the data using a chatbot interface.

🔹 How It Works
1️⃣ Data Loading: The system reads and processes the CSV file using pandas.
2️⃣ Vector Database Creation (FAISS): The text data is converted into embeddings and stored in a FAISS index for fast retrieval.
3️⃣ Query Handling: When a user asks a question, the model retrieves relevant documents from FAISS.
4️⃣ Response Generation (LLM): The retrieved information is passed to an LLM (Large Language Model) to generate a natural language answer.
5️⃣ Chatbot UI (Streamlit): A user-friendly chatbot interface is built using Streamlit, allowing conversational interaction with the dataset.

📌 Technologies & Models Used
Below are the key technologies and models used in the implementation:

1️⃣ FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
📌 What is FAISS?

FAISS is an efficient vector database used for fast retrieval of similar text chunks.
It allows quick similarity searches in large datasets.
📌 Why is FAISS used here?

Instead of searching raw text in a CSV file, we convert text into vectors and store them in FAISS, making queries much faster.
📌 How FAISS works in this project?

Step 1: The CSV data is converted into text chunks.
Step 2: These chunks are embedded using a sentence transformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
Step 3: FAISS stores and retrieves the most relevant chunks based on similarity.
2️⃣ SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
📌 What is this model?

all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is a sentence embedding model from Hugging Face.
It converts text into vector representations, which helps in similarity searches.
📌 Why are embeddings needed?

To compare text effectively, we need a numerical representation.
Example: If a user asks, "What is the body temperature of Patient 2?", we find similar text chunks instead of doing an exact word match.
📌 Why use all-MiniLM-L6-v2 instead of other models?

Faster and lightweight ✅
Good accuracy for sentence similarity ✅
Works well with FAISS ✅
3️⃣ LLM (Large Language Model) – Moondream
📌 What is an LLM?

An LLM is an AI model trained to generate human-like text.
It takes retrieved text and generates a meaningful answer.
📌 Why use moondream LLM?

It’s optimized for answering queries based on context.
It integrates well with FAISS and Streamlit.
📌 How does the LLM work here?

Retrieves relevant documents from FAISS.
Uses the retrieved context to generate a natural response.
Returns the final answer to the user.
4️⃣ Streamlit (For Chatbot UI)
📌 Why use Streamlit?

It’s a lightweight framework for building interactive web apps.
Perfect for AI and ML models that require a simple chatbot-like UI.
📌 What does Streamlit do in this project?

File Upload: Allows users to upload a CSV file.
Chat Interface: Displays user queries & responses.
Real-time Processing: Shows retrieved documents and their sources.
📌 Overall Flow of the Model
1️⃣ User uploads a CSV file → The data is loaded.
2️⃣ FAISS creates a vector store → Data is split into chunks and embedded.
3️⃣ User enters a query → FAISS retrieves the most relevant text.
4️⃣ LLM generates an answer → The retrieved context is used to generate a response.
5️⃣ Chatbot displays the answer → The result is shown to the user.

🔹 Why is This Model Powerful?
✅ Faster than traditional text searches (Uses FAISS for rapid retrieval).
✅ Generates human-like responses (Uses an LLM instead of keyword matching).
✅ Works on any dataset (CSV file can contain any structured data).
✅ User-friendly UI (Built using Streamlit for easy interaction).

This RAG-based chatbot allows fast and interactive querying of patient data, making it ideal for medical data analysis, business intelligence, or any structured document search.
